# sheets-income-taxes
Custom functions for calculating 2022 income tax in Google Sheets. I will try to extend this a bit but **I welcome any and all contributions as PRs**

# Usage
In a Google Sheet, **Extentions -> Apps Script** and replace the code with this. Save the code. You can now call the methods defined in the code using `=INCOMETAX` and `=WATAX` with the parameters defined in the documentation.

# Issue list
* Support MFS/MFJ for Federal Income Tax
* Define method by name, support more years
* Support state taxes

## Please note that this does not support MFJ/MFS yet, and do not rely on this for your taxes as this is not 100% accurate.
